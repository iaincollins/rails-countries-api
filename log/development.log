The Holy See exercises a traditional right to send and receive Ambassadors, to conclude treaties and to participate in international affairs.  Since this legal or political personality is more important than the Pope's temporal sovereignty, it is the 'Holy See' which normally takes part in international relations, is represented at international conferences, and is a party to international conventions.

Her Majesty's Representative is accordingly Her Majesty's Ambassador to the Holy See, not to the Vatican City State.  Citizenship is of the Vatican, but the Vatican uses three different types of passport: Holy See Diplomatic passports, Holy See Service passports, and Vatican City State passports.  Holders of the first two types of passport, which include all members of the Papal diplomatic service, are not usually citizens of the Vatican City State; when they retire or leave the service of the Holy See they revert to their original nationality.  The correct adjective to use depends on the context.  For example, the diplomatic representation of the Holy See should be described as Apostolic (or less correctly Papal) Nunciature, while on the other hand it is correct to speak of the Vatican radio or of a Vatican stamp."}}
